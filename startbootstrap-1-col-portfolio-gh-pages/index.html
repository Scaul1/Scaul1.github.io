        <small>Portfolio</small>
      </h1>

      <p> My name is Sydney Caulfeild and I am currently a Grade 12 Student at A.Y. Jackson Secondary School. This is my second year of studying computer science. I can code in two languages; last year we studied C++ and this year we are coding in JavaScript. I have also learned to code HTML and markdown for my ReadMe files on GitHub Repositores. I have worked on a wide variety of projects this year. To begin with, I have started working on AdvancedJS: Games and Simulations on Khan Academy. I also started working on the Shared Canvas project by watching Dan Shiffman's videos and beginning to code. Both of these can be found in repositories on my GitHub profile. Below are descriptions of the top 10 projects that I would like to be evaluated (there are 9, the 10th project is this GitHub profile).</p>

          <h3>1. Shiffman Coding Challenge</h3>
          <p>This project is a replication of Dan Shiffman's Flappy Bird Coding Challenge. He created a YouTube video where he codes a challenge live. I coded along with him to learn the code. I then added to his game by creating a bird image, modifying the gravity and lift variables, and finally by increasing the speed of the pipes as they approach the bird to make it more challenging. This video demonstrates how the game works: the user presses the space bar to make the bird fly and is attempting to avoid the pipes. If they hit a pipe, the pipes turn red to indicate they've been hit. You can view my code for the project by clicking on "View Project".</p>

          <h3>2. 20-Time Project</h3>  
          <p>Over the course of this semester I have been working on a 20-Time Project, or in other words a project that I dedicate 20% of my time to. I chose to create a soccer injury website that provides information on how to prevent and recover from various injuries. Thsi is a subject that I am very passionate about because I play a lot of soccer and have had a lot of injuries myself. I wanted to share my knowledge on how to recover with others so that they can stay in the game. I used a website called WIX to create my webpage from scratch. I also used JavaScript to code a calendar that I plan on incorporating to demonstrate the different recovery timelines. This image shows the main page for injury prevention.</p>

          <h3>3. Algorithms</h3>
          <p>I have completed the entire Algorithms unit on Khan Academy, including all the challenges and projects. I learned a lot about binary search and recursion, as well as a variety of sorting methods such as insertion sort, quick sort, and merge sort. This image is my project from the selection sort lesson. I coded a visual representation of how selection sort works to arrange numbers into ascending order. You can view the code for this project along with all of my algorithms work by clicking on "View Repository". </p>

          <h3>4. Java Script</h3>
          <p>I have also finished the Intro to JS: Drawing and Animation lesson on Khan Academy. I practiced a wide variety of code, for instance loops, functions, arrays, and objects. This image is from the functions lesson. It is a fish tank that users can make. They can add fish by pressing the mouse and add bubbles by pressing the space bar, both at the current location of the mouse. You can see the code for this project and the rest of my JavaScript work in my GitHub repository.</p>

          <h3>5. HTML/CSS</h3>
          <p>Furthermore, I have finished the HTML/CSS lesson on Khan Academy. I found the styling aspect very interesting and enjoyable! This clip shows a recipe book that I made with links to different sections and three recipes. You can see the code for this project as well as for all of my other projects and challenges in my GitHub repository.</p>

          <h3>6. Natural Simulations</h3>
          <p>Another big portion of this course was spent on learning Natural Simulations by Dan Shiffman on Khan Academy. We focused on noise, vectors, randomness, oscillations and much more. This video clip is from the particle systems lesson. I have two lady bugs that are attracte to a flower and move in an oscillating motion. I also have particle systems of rain that are falling from the clouds. Users can make it rain Winston's by clicking on the canvas with the mouse. You can see the code for this project as well as all of my other Natural Simulations challenges and projects in my GitHub repository.</p>

          <h3>7. Git-it Workflow Tutorial</h3>
          <p>A very signifiant portion of this course was spent learning how to use our workflow as well as it's importance. I have completed the tutorial with Git-it which taught me loads on branches, merging, and more. This image proves that I have worked through this because you can see that all the dots on the lef-hand side are blue. I have also created some notes to help me remember some of the relevant bits of code in a repository on GitHub. </p>

          <h3>8. Making Webpages Interactive</h3>
          <p>Finally, I have also done all of the HTML/JS: Making Webpages Interactive lesson on Khan Acadey. This is one of the challenges I have completed. It is a mad lib game where the user enter words and then I put the words into a story. You can view the code for this challenge as well as all of my other work for this lesson in my repository on GitHub.   </p>

          <h3>9. Embedded Micros</h3>
          <p>I also learned about arduino boards. I worked on this weekly with my group to study the circuits. We managed to get the code to use a button that would turn an LED light on or off. We were also able to modify the code to reverse the roll of the button and incorporate a second LED light. Our progress logs and code can be found in our GitHub repository.</p>

        <h1>Work for the Future</h1>
        
        <ul>
        <li>I would like to continue to learn more about Java Script, especially when it comes to object-oriented coding as I believe that this is an area I can improve in. This would also be very beneficial for the future because it is a much more organized and efficient way of coding the projects that I've been doing. </li>
            <li> I have also learned that I love making interactive code, or in other words games or projects that the users can modify. During my future coding I would like to make more games that inolve user participation.</li>
            <li>This course has also taught me that I am very interested in arduino boards.I would like to continue to learn about these circuit boards to get a better understanding of how they work and how they can be used.</li>
            <li>I would also like to become more comfortable using my workflow so that I can become a more independent coder, meaning rely less on Khan Academy. I have already become much more comfortable with my workflow (GitBash, GitHub and Brackets) through making this portfolio. I have had to edit all of the html on brackets and push my changes from my local repository to my github repository. I have also learned many new techniques. For example, I had to mirror a repository (create a duplicate) of my natural simulations repository because my original one was private and therefore could not be referenced.</li>
            <li>Last but certainly not least, I would like to continue to work on this GitHub profile because I believe that it has the potential to be very beneficial in my future. Whether it be for school or applying for a job I could use this to showcase my abilities. I would like to spend more time using CSS to style it and add different pages to personalize it.</li>
