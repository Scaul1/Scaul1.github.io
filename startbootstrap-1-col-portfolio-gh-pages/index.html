      </h1>

      <p> Hi! My name is Sydney Caulfeild and I am second-year engineering student at Queen's University. I have been studying computer science for three years and will be entering computer engineering in the fall. While in 12th grade I worked on several projects and courses on Khan Academy. The top projects are described below.</p>    
        
      <!-- Project One -->
      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-md-7">

          <h3>1. Shiffman Coding Challenge</h3>
          <p>This project is a replication of Dan Shiffman's Flappy Bird Coding Challenge. He created a YouTube video where he codes a challenge live and I coded along with him to learn the code. I then added to his game by creating a bird image, modifying the gravity and lift variables and increasing the speed of the pipes as they approach the bird to make it more challenging. This video demonstrates how the game works: the user presses the space bar to make the bird fly and is attempting to avoid the pipes. If they hit a pipe, the pipes turn red to indicate they've been hit. You can view my code for the project by clicking on "View Repository".</p>

          <h3>2. 20-Time Project</h3>  
          <p>During Grade 12 I worked on a 20-Time Project, or in other words a project that I dedicate 20% of my time to. I chose to create a soccer injury website that provides information on how to prevent and recover from various injuries. This is a subject that I am very passionate about because after playing soccer at a provincial level I have had my fair share of injuries. I wanted to share my knowledge on how to recover with others so that they can stay in the game. I used a website called WIX to create my webpage from scratch. I also used JavaScript to code a calendar that I plan on incorporating to demonstrate the different recovery timelines. This image shows the main page for injury prevention.</p>

          <h3>3. Algorithms</h3>
          <p>I have completed the entire Algorithms course on Khan Academy. I learned a lot about binary search and recursion, as well as a variety of sorting methods such as insertion sort, quick sort, and merge sort. This image is my project from the selection sort lesson. I coded a visual representation of how selection sort works to arrange numbers into ascending order. You can view the code for this project along with all of my algorithms work by clicking on "View Repository". </p>

          <h3>4. Java Script</h3>
          <p>I have also finished the Intro to JS: Drawing and Animation course on Khan Academy. This image is from a lesson on functions. It is an interactive fish tank where users press their mouse to add fish and press the spacebar to add bubbles. You can see the code for this project and the rest of my JavaScript work in my GitHub repository.</p>

          <h3>5. HTML/CSS</h3>
          <p>Furthermore, I have finished the HTML/CSS: Making Webpages course on Khan Academy. This clip shows a recipe book that I made with links to different sections and three recipes. You can see the code for this project as well as for all of my other projects and challenges in my GitHub repository.</p>

          <h3>6. Natural Simulations</h3>
          <p>Another big portion of this course was spent learning Advanced JS: Natural Simulations by Dan Shiffman on Khan Academy. We focused on noise, vectors, randomness and oscillations. This video clip is from the particle systems lesson. I have two lady bugs that are attracte to a flower and move in an oscillating motion. I also have particle systems of rain that are falling from the clouds. Users can make it rain emoji's by clicking on the canvas with the mouse. You can see the code for this project as well as all of my other Natural Simulations challenges and projects in my GitHub repository.</p>

          <p>A very signifiant portion of this course was spent learning how to use our Git workflow. I have completed the Git-it tutorial which taught the basics of version control. </p>

          <h3>8. Making Webpages Interactive</h3>
          <p>Finally, I have also done the HTML/JS: Making Webpages Interactive course on Khan Acadey. Here is one of the challenges I have completed. It is a Mad Lib game where the user enters words and the program makes a story. You can view the code for this challenge as well as all of my other work for this lesson in my repository on GitHub.   </p>

          <h3>9. Embedded Micros</h3>
          <p>I also learned about Arduino Breadboards. We worked weekly in groups to study circuits and made code to turn an LED light on or off using a button. We were also able to modify the code to reverse the roll of the button and incorporate a second LED light. Our progress logs and code can be found in our GitHub repository.</p>
